# Microsoft Fabric
Scalable analytics can be complex, fragmented, and expensive. With Microsoft Fabric, you don't have to spend all of your time combining various services from different vendors. Instead, you can use a single product that is easy to understand, set up, create, and manage.
In addition to a simple, shared user experience, Fabric is a unified software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering, with all your data stored in a single open format in OneLake.
OneLake is accessible by all of the analytics engines in the platform. 
Fabric offers scalability, cost-effectiveness, accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection, and continuous updates and maintenance provided by Microsoft.
# OneLake
OneLake is Fabric's lake-centric architecture that provides a single, integrated environment for data professionals and the business to collaborate on data projects.
Fabric's OneLake architecture facilitates collaboration between data team members and saves time by eliminating the need to move and copy data between different systems and teams
Fabric's data warehousing, data engineering (lakehouses and notebooks), data integration (pipelines and dataflows), real-time intelligence, and Power BI all use OneLake as their native store without needing any extra configuration.
