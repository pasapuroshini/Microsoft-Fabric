Lakehouses merge data lake storage flexibility with data warehouse analytics. Microsoft Fabric offers a lakehouse solution for comprehensive analytics on a single SaaS platform.

Imagine your company has been using a data warehouse to store structured data from its transactional systems, such as order history, inventory levels, and customer information. You collect unstructured data from social media, website logs, and external sources that are difficult to manage and analyze using the existing data warehouse infrastructure. Your company's new directive is to improve its decision-making capabilities by analyzing data in various formats across multiple sources, so the company chooses Microsoft Fabric.

### Data Warehouse:
A data warehouse is a centralized repository designed specifically for storing, managing, and analyzing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. It plays a key role in enabling organizations to derive insights for decision-making.
Key Features of a Data Warehouse:
Centralized Data Storage:
A data warehouse collects data from various sources (e.g., databases, CRM systems, and IoT devices) into a single, unified repository.

Optimized for Analytics:
Unlike transactional databases, data warehouses are optimized for querying and reporting. They are designed to handle complex queries across large datasets efficiently.

Structured Data:
Data in a warehouse is typically structured, meaning it’s organized into tables with rows and columns, following a defined schema.

Historical Data Storage:
Data warehouses store historical data, making them suitable for trend analysis, forecasting, and long-term decision-making.

Supports Business Intelligence (BI):
Data warehouses serve as the backbone for BI tools, enabling dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics.

Characteristics:
Subject-Oriented: Focuses on specific areas like sales, finance, or customer behavior.
Non-Volatile: Once data is entered, it doesn’t change but is updated or appended periodically.
Integrated: Data from different sources is cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency.
Time-Variant: Allows users to analyze data over specific periods.

Example Use Cases:
Sales Analysis: Analyzing trends and performance across different regions.
Customer Insights: Understanding customer behavior and preferences.
Operational Reporting: Monitoring supply chain metrics or financial health.
In summary, a data warehouse is a foundational tool for businesses to aggregate and analyze data, enabling data-driven strategies and insights.

## Data Lake
A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store vast amounts of raw, unprocessed data in its native format. It is highly scalable and flexible, making it ideal for handling diverse types of data.

A lakehouse presents as a database and is built on top of a data lake using Delta format tables.
Lakehouses store all data formats and can be used with various analytics tools and programming languages. As cloud-based solutions, lakehouses can scale automatically and provide high availability and disaster recovery

Lakehouses use Spark and SQL engines to process large-scale data and support machine learning or predictive modeling analytics.
Lakehouse data is organized in a schema-on-read format, which means you define the schema as needed rather than having a predefined schema.
Lakehouses support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions through Delta Lake formatted tables for data consistency and integrity.
Lakehouses are a single location for data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts to access and use data.

Fabric lakehouses are a central element for your analytics solution. You can follow the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to ingest and transform data before loading to the lakehouse.
You can use your lakehouse for many reasons, including:

Analyze using SQL.
Train machine learning models.
Perform analytics on real-time data.
Develop reports in Power BI.
# Work with Microsoft Fabric lakehouses
## Create and explore a lakehouse
When you create a new lakehouse, you have three different data items automatically created in your workspace.

The lakehouse contains shortcuts, folders, files, and tables.
The Semantic model (default) provides an easy data source for Power BI report developers.
The SQL analytics endpoint allows read-only access to query data with SQL.


## Ingest data into a lakehouse
Upload: Upload local files.
Dataflows Gen2: Import and transform data using Power Query.
Notebooks: Use Apache Spark to ingest, transform, and load data.
Data Factory pipelines: Use the Copy data activity.

Another way to access and use data in Fabric is to use shortcuts. Shortcuts enable you to integrate data into your lakehouse while keeping it stored in external storage.
fter data is ingested, transformed, and loaded, it's ready for others to use. Fabric items provide the flexibility needed for every organization so you can use the tools that work for you.

Data scientists can use notebooks or Data wrangler to explore and train machine learning models for AI.
Report developers can use the semantic model to create Power BI reports.
Analysts can use the SQL analytics endpoint to query, filter, aggregate, and otherwise explore data in lakehouse tables.
By combining the data visualization capabilities of Power BI with the centralized storage and tabular schema of a data lakehouse, you can implement an end-to-end analytics solution on a single platform.
